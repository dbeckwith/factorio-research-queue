# Improved Research Queue

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It can be downloaded from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-research-queue).

## Description

This mod adds a new GUI for managing a queue of research that's easier to use and more featured than the vanilla research queue.

* Maintain a research queue of unlimited size
* Move technologies up and down in the queue
* Adding an unavailable technology to the queue will add all of its prerequisites as well
* Removing a technology from the queue will remove everything that has it as a prerequisite as well
* Easily search and filter technologies to research
* Pause the research queue while you plan, then unpause and watch your queue go
* See estimated time to completion for technologies in the queue
* Receive a chat notification when a research finishes (can turn off in settings)
* Works with any modded technologies and science packs
* In multiplayer, players on the same team will share the same research queue

*Do not use the vanilla research queue with this mod*; this mod will most likely overwrite the vanilla queue. However, starting and cancelling research using the vanilla technology GUI will work fine with this mod. Starting a new research will add it to the start of the queue and unpause the queue. Cancelling the current research will pause the queue.

Note: while using this mod you probably want to turn off the setting that brings up the technology screen after every research. Disable the option under `Settings` -> `Interface` -> `Interaction` -> `Technology screen opens when research is completed`.

This mod is intended to replace these other great but outdated mods:

* [Research queue](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/research-queue) / [Research Queue: The Old New Thing](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/research-queue-the-old-new-thing) / [Research Queue: The Old New Thing, 0.18.34 fix](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/research-queue-0-18-34)
* [Deadlock's Research Notifications](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockResearchNotifications)

## How to Use

To open the Improved Research Queue window, use the shortcut on your shortcut bar or press `Shift+T`. You will see a list of technologies in the center, the queue on the left, and settings/filters on the right. Hover over any element to see additional info and descriptions of how to use it.
