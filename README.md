# Improved Research Queue

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It can be downloaded from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-research-queue).

## Description

This mod adds a new GUI for managing a queue of research that's easier to use and more featured than the vanilla research queue.

* Maintain a research queue of unlimited size
* Move technologies up and down in the queue
* Adding an unavailable technology to the queue will add all of its prerequisites as well
* Removing a technology from the queue will remove all of its prerequisites as well
* Easily search and filter technologies to research

*Do not use the vanilla research queue with this mod*; the mod will most likely overwrite the vanilla queue. However, starting and cancelling research using the vanilla technology GUI will work fine with this mod.

## Default hotkeys

* `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R` - Open Research Queue GUI
* `Ctrl+F` - Focus search field
