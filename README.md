# Improved Research Queue

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It can be downloaded from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-research-queue).

## Description

This mod adds a new GUI for managing a queue of research that's easier to use and more featured than the vanilla research queue.

* Maintain a research queue of unlimited size
* Move technologies up and down in the queue
* Adding an unavailable technology to the queue will add all of its prerequisites as well
* Removing a technology from the queue will remove everything that has it as a prerequisite as well
* Easily search and filter technologies to research
* Pause the research queue while you plan, then unpause and watch your queue go
* See estimated time to completion for technologies in the queue
* Works with any modded technologies and science packs

*Do not use the vanilla research queue with this mod*; the mod will most likely overwrite the vanilla queue. However, starting and cancelling research using the vanilla technology GUI will work fine with this mod. Starting a new research will add it to the start of the queue and unpause the queue. Cancelling the current research will pause the queue.

Note: while using this mod you probably want to turn off the setting that brings up the technology screen after every research. Disable the option under `Settings` -> `Interface` -> `Interaction` -> `Technology screen opens when research is completed`.

## Default hotkeys

* `Shift+T` - Open Research Queue GUI
* `Ctrl+F` - Focus search field
